# Restaurant Page

[Simple Restaurant Landing Page](https://jianrong7.github.io/restaurantpage/) for The Odin Project.
Using HTMl, CSS and Javascript. 

### The page is completely rendered using Javascript, using modules as well as webpack to bundle the modules.

It was quite interesting building the project just based on JS. It is still quite new to me and I am trying to figure out what each of the functions is for. Ultimately, I feel that this way of rendering the page is also quite efficient.

## What I Learnt
- Modules
- Webpack
- More familiar with forEach functions
- DOMContentLoaded EventListener
- IIFE
- Importing and Exporting JS Modules
- More familiar with creating and appending HTML Elements using JS

## What I need to improve on
- Learn the importance and relevance of webpack
- The usage of "active" elements
